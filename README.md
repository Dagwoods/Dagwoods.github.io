<h3><u>About Me</u></h3>
Hi! My name is Jack MacCormack. I'm currently a junior studying Information Technology (IT) at James Madison University, and minoring in Computer Science and Creative Writing!
Outside of classes, I spend most of my time volunteering around Harrisonburg, both through my service org. Alpha Phi Omega, and on my own at a local cat cafe/adoption center!
In fact I have over 50 hours of volunteer work since coming to JMU alone!
