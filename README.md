<h3><u>About Me</u></h3>
Hi! My name is Jack MacCormack. I'm currently a junior studying Information Technology (IT) at James Madison University, and minoring in Computer Science and Creative Writing!
Outside of classes, I spend most of my time volunteering around Harrisonburg, both through my service org. Alpha Phi Omega, and on my own at a local cat cafe/adoption center!
In fact I have over 50 hours of volunteer work since coming to JMU alone!

<h3><u>Experience</u></h3>
Recipe Manager App - "KILowBites" - 2023

Worked as part of a team to develop the app using Java Swing
Used agile developing process Scrum to build specifications from the product owner
Developed skills in team communication, task prioritization, and product negotiation


Mover – “Wayforth” – June-August 2022

Worked as a professional mover over the summer. Primarily downsized senior citizens into smaller homes or into assisted living. 
Learned to handle aggressive people in a professional manner, how to work efficiently in a team, and manage tasks in a timely fashion
