<h3><u>About Me</u></h3>
Hi! My name is Jack MacCormack. I'm currently a junior studying Information Technology (IT) at James Madison University, and minoring in Computer Science and Creative Writing!
Outside of classes, I spend most of my time volunteering around Harrisonburg, both through my service org. Alpha Phi Omega, and on my own at a local cat cafe/adoption center!
In fact I have over 50 hours of volunteer work since coming to JMU alone!

<h3><u>Experience</u></h3>
Recipe Manager App - "KILowBites" - 2023

Worked as part of a team to develop the app using Java Swing
Used agile developing process Scrum to build specifications from the product owner
Developed skills in team communication, task prioritization, and product negotiation


Mover – “Wayforth” – June-August 2022

Worked as a professional mover over the summer. Primarily downsized senior citizens into smaller homes or into assisted living. 
Learned to handle aggressive people in a professional manner, how to work efficiently in a team, and manage tasks in a timely fashion


<h3><u>Alpha Phi Omega</u></h3>
Alpha Phi Omega (APO) is a volunteer organization at JMU. We serve a diverse local community with an open-minded and judgement free approach. Some of the projects we serve at include helping out at pet shelters, caring for residents at assisted living homes, and performing manual labor tasks to create a sustainable and ecologically responsible food sources on locally owned farms.
In 2023, I served as Pledge Class President in order to foster a sense of community and teamwork within the org and my pledge class. I held weekly meetings to discuss upcoming tasks and goals for our class.
Serving as pledge class president gave me great insight on how to effectively manage a diverse team, and grew my leadership skills tremendously.


<h3<u>What's Next?<u><h3>
This summer, I'll be studying abroad in Italy to obtain more experience of the global world. During the upcoming fall semester, I will be continuing with my IT classes, specifially focusing on cyber security and telecommunications.
